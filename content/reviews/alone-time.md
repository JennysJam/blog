I enjoyed the setup for this book, but found the plot twists and changes more confusing and hard to follow as it went on, as the dual perspectives of the characters during the time of the plane crash and the characters in modern day, dealing with media attention. I think given time I could appreciate more the sort of messy web of half truths and manipulations work out, but the actual conclusion is also confusing and seems to not have the consequences other parts of the story have that set it up, and some of the revelations feel kind of cheap, and weirdly sensationalist in the way the magic thing works.

I don't know if I'd recommend this book, but I definitely felt myself appreciating it at times.
