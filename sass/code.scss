// coloring and styling code blocks
// This page is going to be more gnarly than the others, because unless we
// pre-bake the color scheme in (I think there's a now-lost local branch
// trying to recolor some of the various builtin color chemes), we need to manually update it

// we may end up stealing `prototype.html` again to test the stylescheme stuff
